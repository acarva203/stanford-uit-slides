# stanford-uit-slides — Build Procedure (Complement to SKILL.md)

> **This file supplies the HOW.** `SKILL.md` describes *what* the
> `stanford-uit-slides` skill is, *which* templates exist, *which* content
> structures it offers, and the *brand promises* it makes. It contains **no
> build procedure**. This document is the executable companion: exact input
> paths, the end-to-end generation procedure with selector citations, the CSS→EMU
> unit-translation rules, per-slide-type python-pptx recipes, branding
> application, the asset-integrity status (now mostly remediated — see §7), and a
> runnable compliance
> evaluator. All values are quoted from repo files; every in-repo conflict is
> flagged explicitly (see §8.4) rather than silently resolved.

## §1. Purpose & relationship to SKILL.md

- **SKILL.md** = declarative spec (templates, content types, brand promises).
- **This file** = imperative build steps an agent can follow without re-deriving
  any value.
- Read order: SKILL.md first (context), then this file (execution).
- This file does not duplicate SKILL.md or invent layouts. Every layout key
  named here exists in the corresponding `template-configs/<tpl>/layouts.json`.

---

## §2. Inputs (exact paths — all verified to exist)

Repo root: `/Users/asirur/claude_skills/project1_uit/stanford-uit-slides`

| Purpose | Path |
|---|---|
| Skill spec | `SKILL.md` |
| Template selector logic | `integration/template-selector.json` |
| Brand colors / typography + asset references (master) | `shared-assets/stanford-uit-branding.json` |
| Compliance rules / scoring | `validation/brand-compliance.json` |
| Font filename mappings | `shared-assets/font-mappings.json` |
| PPTX handoff / canvas config | `integration/pptx-handoff-config.json` |
| Per-template theme | `template-configs/<tpl>/theme.json` |
| Per-template layouts | `template-configs/<tpl>/layouts.json` |
| Per-template master slides | `template-configs/<tpl>/master-slides.json` |
| Per-template metadata | `template-configs/<tpl>/metadata.json` |
| Fonts on disk | `shared-assets/fonts/` |
| Logos on disk | `shared-assets/logos/` |
| Icons on disk | `shared-assets/icons/` |

where `<tpl>` ∈ {`sunset`, `noe`, `castro`, `mission`}.

> **Path note (changed):** the recent "incorrect file references" commits moved
> several files. `template-selector.json` now lives under **`integration/`**
> (not `validation/`). The former `validation/stanford-uit-branding.json` and the
> separate `shared-assets/config/branding.json` are now a **single merged file**,
> `shared-assets/stanford-uit-branding.json`, which holds brand colors,
> typography, logo references, and service-icon references together. There is no
> longer a `shared-assets/config/` directory; `font-mappings.json` is now at
> `shared-assets/font-mappings.json`.

> **Canvas note (corrected — verified against the source `.pptx`):** all three
> 16:9 templates are **10in × 5.625in** (`9,144,000 × 5,143,500 EMU`) — the legacy
> PowerPoint 16:9 size, read directly from each file's
> `p:sldSz cx="9144000" cy="5143500"`. Earlier drafts of this file and the configs
> claimed `13.33in × 7.5in`; that was **wrong** and has been corrected here, in the
> three `theme.json`, and in `integration/pptx-handoff-config.json`. Mission is
> 16:10 at **10in × 6.25in** (`9,144,000 × 5,715,000 EMU`). See §4 for the
> unit math on the true canvas.

## §3. Template selection procedure (cited to `integration/template-selector.json`)

Apply in precedence order; first match wins, then validate against audience
avoid-lists.

**Step 1.1 — explicit template request.** If the caller names a template, use it
(subject to Step 1.5 audience avoidance warning).

**Step 1.2 — presentation_type_mapping.** Look up the requested type in
`presentation_type_mapping`. Verified primaries:
- `incident_report.primary = noe`
- `strategic_planning.primary = mission`
- `service_update.primary = sunset`
- `technical_briefing.primary = sunset` *(NOT noe — common mistake)*
- `security_training.primary = noe`

**Step 1.3 — keyword_triggers** (fall back to keyword scan of the brief):
- `executive, leadership, pitch, strategy, high-level, board` → **castro**
- `standard, general, briefing, update, routine, regular` → **sunset**
- `data, technical, metrics, analysis, detailed, research` → **noe**
- `mission, vision, …, culture` → **mission**

**Step 1.4 — audience_preferences.** e.g. `executive_leadership`:
preferred `[castro, mission]`, avoid `[noe]`. If a Step 1.2/1.3 result lands on
an avoided template for the stated audience, warn and prefer an allowed one.

**Step 1.5 — fallback.** `default` / `uncertain` → **sunset**.

> Regression coverage exists: tests `selection_001`, `selection_002`, `font_001`
> in the validation suite assert the above values.

## §4. Unit translation (CSS px / % / in → python-pptx EMU)

python-pptx geometry uses **EMU**. Constants:
`1 inch = 914400 EMU`, `1 pt = 12700 EMU`.

### §4.1 Units the layouts actually use
The 16:9 `layouts.json` files are **percentage / keyword based** (`"100%"`,
`"80%"`, `"center"`, `"38%"`), with only small absolute `px` values for
decorative offsets (borders, gaps — none exceed ~110px). There is **no
1280×720 grid**; that claim in earlier drafts was fabricated. Mission declares an
explicit **1000×625 px grid** (`mission/theme.json` `px_width/px_height`), i.e.
**100 px/in**, so for Mission `1 px = 9144 EMU`. Apply the same 100 px/in to the
stray px offsets in the other templates unless a layout says otherwise.

Resolution rules:
- **`%`** → fraction × the **canvas EMU** for that axis (see §4.2).
- **`px`** → `px × 9144 EMU` (100 px/in grid).
- **`center` / keywords** → compute from element size against the canvas.

### §4.2 Canvas EMU (verified from each source `.pptx`)
| Template(s) | Inches | Width EMU | Height EMU |
|---|---|---|---|
| Sunset / Noe / Castro (16:9) | 10 × 5.625 | **9,144,000** | **5,143,500** |
| Mission (16:10) | 10 × 6.25 | **9,144,000** | **5,715,000** |

All four templates are **10in (9,144,000 EMU) wide**; only the height differs.
Do not use 13.33in / 12,192,000 EMU anywhere — that canvas does not exist in
these files.

### §4.3 % → EMU
`pct_of_width × 9,144,000` (all templates, since width is uniform), and
`pct_of_height ×` 5,143,500 (16:9) or 5,715,000 (Mission).

### §4.4 Worked `calc()` examples (recomputed on the true 10in canvas)
At 100 px/in (`1px = 9144 EMU`, `width = 9,144,000 EMU`):

| Field | CSS | Inches | EMU |
|---|---|---|---|
| `two_column` right_column x | `calc(52% + 0px)` | `0.52×10 = 5.2in` | **4,754,880** |
| `content_slide` content_area w | `calc(100% − 80px)` | `10in − 0.8in = 9.2in` | **8,412,480** |

> **Flag:** these replace the old 13.333in-basis figures (6,339,682 /
> 11,429,714), which were computed against a canvas width that does not exist.
> The px term uses the 100 px/in grid Mission declares; if a 16:9 layout proves
> to use a different dpi for its px offsets, recompute that term accordingly.

### §4.5 Verified spacing/logo constants (no change)
`76200`, `762000`, `380990 ≈ 381000`, `1047750`, `2606040`; logo dims
`0.625in` / `1.6667in`. Mission `px/100` conversions and all Mission coordinates
match `template-configs/mission/layouts.json`.

---

## §5. Per-slide-type python-pptx recipes

For each template, read `layouts.json` for the named layout, translate each
element's `x/y/w/h` per §4, set fonts/colors per §6, then place text/shapes.

### §5.1 Key per-template values (cite the layout, not the theme)
- **Noe** title slide `overline_label`: **11pt** — source
  `noe/layouts.json` (overline_label `font_size "11pt"`). Note `noe/theme.json`
  `label_font` is 10pt; if challenged, cite the **layout**.
- **Castro** `stat_callout` → `stat_number`: **64pt**, family `Source Sans 3`
  (fallback Roboto), weight 900, color `#F5C518` — source `castro/layouts.json`
  (lines 219–224). Note: the stat color in `layouts.json` is still `#F5C518`
  while `castro/theme.json` now uses the true Stanford gold `#FEC51D`; reconcile.
  > **Flag:** `castro/theme.json` `stat_font` declares **72pt** (line 57). This
  > 72pt-vs-64pt divergence is a real in-repo conflict (see §8.4); render from
  > the layout (64pt) and flag.

### §5.2 Mission dividers
Mission uses full-bleed section dividers. Use the `layout_index` keys
1/2/6/9/10/14/15/19 from `mission/layouts.json` (the JSON field is literally
`layout_index`). Divider background/text colors and all cited coordinates match
that file. Mission has **21** layouts total (consistent with its metadata).

## §6. Branding application

### §6.1 Profiles (from `integration/pptx-handoff-config.json`)
All four profiles' `primary_logo`, `color_emphasis`, and `typography_weight`
match the handoff config exactly; the narrative profile's `special_features`
are as cited. Apply the profile matching the chosen template.

### §6.2 Colors (verified hexes)
All hexes match `shared-assets/stanford-uit-branding.json` and
`mission/theme.json` `brand_colors`. Prohibited-color set matches
`validation/brand-compliance.json`:
`prohibited_colors.low_contrast = ["#CCCCCC", "#EEEEEE"]` (line 30).

---

## §7. Asset-integrity status (mostly remediated — remaining defects flagged)

The recent commits fixed most of the asset-reference defects this section used
to enumerate. The logo refs were repointed from nonexistent `.svg` to real
PNGs, the font family was switched to Source Sans 3 / Roboto (both on disk), and
the missing-icon block was deleted. What remains is one logo-naming mismatch and
two path-style quirks; everything else now resolves.

### §7.1 Logos — now PNGs; **only the cardinal refs are still broken**
`shared-assets/stanford-uit-branding.json` now references 6 PNGs (was 6 missing
`.svg`). The black and white refs match disk exactly. The **two cardinal refs
do not**:

| Referenced in branding.json | Real on-disk file | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `University-IT_wordmark_horizontal_black.png` | same | ✅ OK |
| `University-IT_wordmark_horizontal_white.png` | same | ✅ OK |
| `University-IT_wordmark_vertical_black.png` | same | ✅ OK |
| `University-IT_wordmark_vertical_white.png` | same | ✅ OK |
| `University-IT_wordmark_horizontal_cardinal.png` | `…horizontal_cardinal-black.png` | ❌ missing `-black` |
| `University-IT_wordmark_vertical_cardinal.png` | `…vertical_cardinal-black.png` | ❌ missing `-black` |

Rule: when resolving a `*_cardinal.png` ref, substitute
**`*_cardinal-black.png`** (the only cardinal variant on disk). The horizontal
"stacked" naming is now `vertical` on both sides, so the old stacked↔vertical
remap is no longer needed.

### §7.2 Fonts — resolved (Source Sans 3 + Roboto), with a path-slash quirk
`shared-assets/font-mappings.json` now declares family **`Source Sans 3`** and
references **`/fonts/SourceSans3-{Light,Regular,SemiBold,Bold}.woff2`** — all
present at `shared-assets/fonts/`. The old `woff`/`ttf` variants and the
`platform_compatibility` block were removed; only `woff2` is listed now. The
monospace family was changed from the missing **Monaco** to **`Roboto`**,
referencing `fonts/Roboto-Regular.ttf`, which **now exists** on disk. So there is
no remaining missing-font defect.

> **Flag (path style):** the Source Sans entries use a leading-slash
> `"/fonts/SourceSans3-*.woff2"` while the Roboto entry uses
> `"fonts/Roboto-Regular.ttf"` (no leading slash). Neither is the on-disk prefix
> (`shared-assets/fonts/`). Resolve both relative to `shared-assets/`, stripping
> any leading slash.

### §7.3 Icons — missing-icon refs removed; service icons resolve
The `technical_elements.status_indicators` block that referenced
`icons/check.svg`, `icons/wrench.svg`, and `icons/alert.svg` (all absent) was
**deleted** from the branding file, so those broken refs no longer exist. The
remaining `service_icons` refs — `email-icon.svg`, `wifi-icon.svg`,
`security/shield-icon.svg` — all exist at their cited paths. (Disk also carries
unreferenced icons: `vpn`, `lock`, `warning`, `cloud`, `server`.)

## §8. Compliance evaluator (runnable, cited to `brand-compliance.json`)

### §8.1 Prohibited-color check
Flag any element color in `prohibited_colors.low_contrast`
(`#CCCCCC`, `#EEEEEE`).

> **Flag (see §8.4):** Castro uses `#CCCCCC` pervasively (theme `body_font`,
> layouts content_area/subtitle/stat_label, master-slides, title_slide
> subtitle). A literal prohibited-color check therefore flags **every Castro
> content slide**. Reconcile before enforcing.

### §8.2 WCAG contrast (formula verified)
Relative luminance per channel `c`: `cs = c/255`; `lin = cs/12.92 if cs ≤
0.03928 else ((cs+0.055)/1.055)**2.4`; `L = 0.2126R + 0.7152G + 0.0722B`;
ratio `(Llight+0.05)/(Ldark+0.05)`. Verified ratios:

| Pair | Ratio | Verdict |
|---|---|---|
| Cardinal text | 9.40 | PASS |
| Success | 7.59 | PASS |
| Error | 7.26 | PASS |
| Warning gold | 2.03 | **FAIL** |
| Black on gold | 10.32 | PASS |
| Dark on illuminating | 8.77 | PASS |

### §8.3 Scoring (matches `brand-compliance.json`)
Deductions: **−50** (critical), **−20** (major), **−5** (minor).
`passing_score = 85`, `excellence_score = 95`. Escalation strings:
`block_presentation_generation`, `alert_uit_design_team`, halt-on-critical.

### §8.4 In-repo conflicts to reconcile (DO NOT silently resolve)
1. **Castro logo placement:** `castro/theme.json` allows `bottom_left`, but
   `brand-compliance.json` `prohibited_usage.placement` prohibits it.
2. **Logo minimum size:** `stanford-uit-branding.json`
   (`minimum_width = "2_inches_horizontal_1.5_inches_stacked"`) says 2in/1.5in;
   `brand-compliance.json` says 1in.
3. **Cool Grey:** `stanford-uit-branding.json` `cool_grey = #4D4F53`; Stanford official and
   `mission/theme.json` `text_muted = #53565A`. Both hexes confirmed present in
   their files; they disagree.
4. **Fonts standardized:** all templates now use **Source Sans 3** (primary) with
   **Roboto** (fallback). Earlier per-template fonts (Georgia/Calibri/Arial Black)
   have been removed from the configs; verify `approved_fonts` lists Source Sans 3
   and Roboto.
5. **Castro stat font size:** theme.json 72pt vs layouts.json 64pt (§5.1).
6. **Castro `#CCCCCC` body text** is on the prohibited `low_contrast` list yet is
   the documented Castro body color (§8.1). `castro/metadata.json` even
   instructs "Body text should use #CCCCCC or lighter" — directly contradicting
   the prohibited list. Decide policy before enforcing the §8.1 check.

---

## §9. Edge cases & fallbacks
- Missing asset → apply §7 substitution (cardinal logo → `*_cardinal-black.png`;
  strip leading slash and resolve fonts under `shared-assets/fonts/`). If a
  referenced asset genuinely has no on-disk match, degrade gracefully and log.
- Selection uncertain → sunset (§3 Step 1.5).
- Unit convention → pick px-grid **or** inch-exact (§4.2) and stay consistent.
- Prohibited-color / placement / size conflicts (§8.4) → surface to the caller;
  do not auto-resolve.
